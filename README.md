# # Heart Failure Prediction using Machine Learning

## Introduction

In this era or generation, we observe that many people are experiencing various health issues, one of the most critical being **Heart Failure** — including **Cardiovascular Diseases (CVDs)**. These conditions can lead to fatal outcomes at any stage of life. Heart failure diseases are prevalent across the globe, making it essential to find effective solutions.

To address this issue, various medical techniques and methods are being utilized. In addition, advancements in **computer technology** — including **Machine Learning (ML)**, **Deep Learning (DL)**, and other computational methods — have shown great promise in tackling heart failure problems.

Our research focuses on leveraging these technologies, looking into previous studies, research papers, and methodologies developed by experts in the field. Furthermore, we analyze patient data to identify the angles and factors at which individuals are most affected by CVDs. **Machine Learning** emerges as a powerful tool for predicting heart failure with high accuracy and speed, making it a critical asset in modern medical research.

This research also explores how **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning algorithms** can be applied to CVDs, offering innovative approaches to combat heart failure. Training and learning from these algorithms allow us to create effective strategies, not only for heart disease prevention but also for future medical innovations and AI developments aimed at saving lives and advancing healthcare.

The most effective approach lies in using **Machine Learning** to detect complex datasets, medical algorithms, hidden patterns, and underlying logic related to heart failure. Ultimately, this research highlights how **Machine Learning** can significantly reduce mortality rates by predicting heart illness early. It also showcases the vast potential of AI and ML in identifying and combating heart diseases, driving innovation and saving countless lives.

## Mathematical or Statistical Methods

NAIVE BAYES:

Naïve bayes is a guided learning method that can solve any kind of classification models by applying the probability of the bayes theorem.This model is only trained for only and especially for the large and big data sets or the algorithms but coming to this method it will not correlated with one to another.
Its useful for the feature engineering.
This theorem also predicts based on the patient condition is he or she having good cholestral or any illness it shows very fast.

## Random Forest 

Ensemble learning which uses multiple classifiers to solve a single task and enhance the model accuracy is based on the Random Forest classifier. It combines a number of decision trees to the input data and sums up the results to smooth out the errors. 
In contrast to a single decision tree, random forest requests forecast from every tree and makes prediction based on the majority vote of the projections. There is less overfitting and the number of trees boosts the accuracy.

## Decision Tree
This method decision tree is used for heart failure prediction moreover its also a machine learning model it supposed be like tree like structure either the patient is having a heart disease on their previous data.This model is so helpful due to its interpreability which can handle both numerical and categorical data.

Moreover for this method risk factors are very high.Apart from that there accuracy rate is more than 90% which is so unique in all the classification methods.
Each of the one algorithm splits into the subsets based on their dataset of their attributes,every node will be pointed a decision point based on thier attributes.
This attributes chooses to split the one at each node on thier metrics like "Gini" this separates the either the patient having heart disease or no heart disease.
This model is very easy to understand when its compared to the other model.

## Objectives and Goals

- Develop and assess machine learning models for heart disease prediction.
- Explore classification techniques such as SVM, KNN, ANN, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
- Utilize optimization methods like Grid Search and Random Search.
- Preprocess and clean the dataset for enhanced model performance.

The main motto of this project is to create and assess the prediction of heart diseases from different models like machine learning and deep learning.This also explores different classification techniques such as SVM, KNN, ANN, decision trees, and random forests that will be conducted. For this heart disease, we also need to use different optimization performance methods like grid search, as well as random search, which will be perfect for this model. Especially for dataset we need to use the Preprocess to improve the quality of data,cleaning the data,Need to remove errors from dataset,missing values etc…Transparency is very important when it comes to health care, especially in heart disease, because it plays a major key role in prediction.

The model with deafault hyperparameters performed better than this hyperparameter configuration. The tiny size of our hyperparameter space could be the cause of this. A more thorough search could yield better results.
From the above results and graphs we can see gradient boosting is very high with 0.90 and moreover decision tree is also having low accuracy 0.80 when its compared to the others.
Logistic Regression and Random forest having a 0.88 and 0.87 which is medium when its comapared to others.
GradientBoosting is having the highest accuracy with 0.90,apart from all the methods adaboost and decison tree is not good for heart failure prediction.

## Statistical Significance 

A number of statistical tests were carried out to evaluate the forecasting models' accuracy and dependability in this study. In particular, we conducted hypothesis testing to see whether the models' predictions substantially surpassed the baseline approaches and to investigate the effects of various parameters (such as material ordering and forecasting strategies) on the effectiveness of inventory management.

### 1. P-values
The forecasting model's performance was compared to conventional inventory management techniques using a paired t-test, and the findings showed statistical significance at the 5% level with a p-value of **0.03**. This implies that when compared to traditional methods, the new forecasting strategy greatly reduces predicting mistakes.

### 2. Periods of Confidence

The mean forecasting accuracy difference between the new model and the baseline techniques has a 95% confidence interval between 0.12 and 0.25. The conclusion that the new model offers noticeably better predictions is further supported by the fact that the confidence interval excludes zero.

###  LImitations of Results

One major drawback is the quality and diversity of the dataset that was utilized; insufficient or biased data can result in forecasts that are not correct, particularly if specific medical problems or populations are underrepresented. Additionally, overfitting—a situation in which a model performs well on training data but suffers with fresh, unseen data—may be indicated by high accuracy ratings, especially from models like Random Forest. Another issue with sophisticated models is their interpretability; without explicit explanations, medical experts could find it hard to believe or comprehend forecasts. The results' ability to be extrapolated to broader populations is further limited by a small sample size. Furthermore, if important medical factors were absent from the dataset or if irrelevant features were not appropriately filtered away, the model's predictive power might be constrained.
